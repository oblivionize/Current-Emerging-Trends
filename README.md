Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
    
     For this project I the only part I had to code was the AI learning. Everything else was already made beforehand. I had to make a deep Q-Training algorithm that allows the "pirate" to find the treasure in the maze. The goal of this project was to find the maximum number of epochs to get a 100% accuracy rate.
