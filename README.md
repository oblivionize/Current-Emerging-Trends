• Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
   
For this project I the only part I had to code was the AI learning. Everything else was already made beforehand. I had to make a deep Q-Training algorithm that allows the "pirate" to find the treasure in the maze. The goal of this project was to find the maximum number of epochs to get a 100% accuracy rate.
     
• What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
         
Computer scientists solve problems using techonology. This includes designing, developing, and troubleshooting software in order to meet user/client needs. Ultimately the main goal of computer science is effective problem solving. Since technology is so intergrated in the modern world its important that we have people who specialize and can solve problems related to technology.

• How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

I first like to identify the problem before working on it. Without a good grasp of the subject/issue it can be difficult to figure out what exactly you need to work on. From there I will work to solve the problem and attempt to implement a solution. From there I can test the solution to make sure that it works that way I want it to and to make sure the problem is fixed.

• What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

I think the most important ethical responsibility is the user's informational privacy. To add to this, I need to make sure that software I design protects users from malicious activites from the internet. Furthermore, it is important to be honest with your users and tell them how you use their data for that particular software. That way people know exactly what information is being used.
